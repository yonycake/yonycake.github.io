Ahhh, don't forget the kids. If this were the 1900's one could ship kids via the U.S Postal Servive. Don't believe me? Check out this quick fact, <a href="http://boingboing.net/2008/06/24/shipping-children-by.html" target="_blank">kids ship via mail</a>.

Still got a lot of junk to filter through. The best thing is to take most of all this and sell it. We can take advantage of "Craigslist", a garage sale, and more recently "Letgo", which we've used to sell an old blender. Hopefully we can sell most of these items, cause if not, we'll have to haul like mules.
