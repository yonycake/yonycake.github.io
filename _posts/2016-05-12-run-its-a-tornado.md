It looks like a Tornado went through the house! Especially when you have a energetic two year old, that energy is on full blown overdrive! She is everywhere, I'm running after her like a chicken without a head! She keeps me on my toes, but she just has the biggest heart ♡ I have been spending so much time going through the stuff I've never used or just plane forgot! No no no no, I'm packing light make it easier on us, less is definitely more!!! More time to love and care for my beautiful little family ♡ counting down the days U.S.V.I here we come!
